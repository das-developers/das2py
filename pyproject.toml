# This does not work with top-level non-module python scripts.  Instead we're
# expected to make a module named "verify" and point out it's main function
# here.  That's okay I guess, but it gets very far from the shell-script roots
# of python and makes it harder to run scripts directly from the source tree
# as top-level programs, which is an long expected feature.  For now the
# 'scripts=' line in setup.py is going to have to handle this one.
