	# Variable names that higher level code will know how to interpret:
	#
	#  center - Absolute point in a dimension, center of bin 
	#
	#  min    - Absolute point in a dimension, start of bin
	#
	#  max    - Absolute point in a dimension, end of bin
	#
	#  width  - Difference value in a dimesion, width of bin
	#
	#  mean   - Absolute point in a dimension, average value in a bin
	#
	#  mode   - Absolute point in a dimension, most frequent value in a bin
	#
	#  reference - Same as 'min' but is usually paired with 'offset'
	#
	#  offset - Difference value in dimenision, to be added to reference,
	#            very handy for waveforms where start time and offsets
	#            should be denoted separately for automatic power spectral
	#            density calculations.
	#
	#  max_error - Absolute point in a dimension, denotes uncertianty
	#
	#  min_error - Absolute point in a dimension, denotes uncertianty 
	#
	#  uncertianty - Difference value in a dimension, denotes uncertianty
	#            assumed to be centered on 'center'
	#
	#  std_dev - Standard deviation of values in a bin, does *not* have
	#            the same absolute or difference units as the center
	#            values.
	#
	#  point_spread - A sub-iteration array of difference values from
	#            a reference point.
	#
	#  weight - An sub-iteration array of weights for a point_spread
	#   
	# Not all of these are supplied in each dateset, in fact most of 
	# them aren't.  Typically only the center Variable is supplied.

	# ignore the index map
