das2py versioning has been reset to match the 
<a href="">github</a> project and has switched to semantic versioning.
Please issue:
<ul>
  <li>conda remove das2py</li>
  <li>conda install -c dasdevelopers das2py</li>
</ul>
to update. This will provide version github version 2.3.0, which is the
newest release and is newer then the 2.3.1 version previously posted here.
Sorry for the confusion.  Now that the anaconda and github versions are
in sync, no further version revisions are expected.

To test your installation issue:
<ul>
<li>conda install matplotlib (if you don't already have it)</li>
<li>wget http://das2.org/das2py/examples/ex02_galileo_pws_spectra.py</li>
<li>python ex02_galileo_pws_spectra.py</li>
</ul>
You should get the same plot as the one at: 
<a href="http://das2.org/das2py/examples/ex02_galileo_pws_spectra.png">ex02\_galileo\_pws\_spectra.png</a>

Thanks for trying das2py :)
